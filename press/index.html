		<p>See what people are saying about Knock Every Door in the press! </p>

		<p><strong>2/21/2017 - NowThis -</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1461040963927389/">“These Bernie Sanders supporters have a novel approach to America’s political problems: listening to people” (VIDEO)</a></p>

		<p><strong>2/28/2017 - Mother Jones -</strong> <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/these-democrats-are-going-door-door-asking-trump-voters-simple-question">“These Bernie Alums Think They’ve Found the Secret to Reaching Trump Voters”</a></p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p>“On an icy Saturday afternoon in early February, the rebuilding of the 
		  Democratic party was happening in Jessica Williams’ Long Island living 
		  room. Williams, a social worker who in her free time hosts a podcast 
		  about dance, supported Bernie Sanders during the presidential primary 
		  but hadn’t volunteered for a political campaign in years. Everything 
		  changed in November. “I was like, holy crap, this democracy business 
		  is a whole lot more fragile than I realized,” she says.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p><strong>3/7/2017 - Yahoo News -</strong> <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/resistance-report-these-blue-state-liberals-have-a-long-shot-plan-to-retake-the-house-on-their-own-211618549.html">“Resistance Report: These blue state liberals have a long-shot plan to retake the House on their own”</a></p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p>“The connection to Knock Every Door was especially appealing to Freel. 
		  One of its first initiatives is research oriented: talking to voters, 
		  finding out what their concerns are, really getting to know the 
		  districts as a collection of people and stories instead of data 
		  points. That means talking to everyone, Democrats and Republicans, 
		  instead of just to select targeted voters likely to turn out to vote 
		  for a Democrat. “Why would you vote this person in?” is something 
		  Freel said she had trouble understanding of those who had backed 
		  Trump.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p><strong>3/27/2017 - The Nation -</strong> <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/your-guide-to-the-sprawling-new-anti-trump-resistance-movement/">“Your Guide to the Sprawling New Anti-Trump Resistance Movement”</a></p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p>“So our approach is radical trust in volunteers—not just to knock on 
		  doors, but to organize their neighbors to knock on doors, to lead 
		  canvassing trainings, to barnstorm their communities, and even to run 
		  critical pieces of campaign infrastructure and technology. That’s the 
		  only way you can organize at a scale where it really is possible to 
		  knock on every door.”</p>
